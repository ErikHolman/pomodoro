# pomodoro

todos:

- Exception for text base input
- In selected.py
  - Pull those functions in option 3 out somewhere else. Maybe along side the pomodoro selection function
  - make private
- Remove all int cast for the user choice
- Switch statement for the selected function would read better
- Timer to dedicated thread
